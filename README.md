# NYC-Trip-Duration
An end-to-end machine learning project for NYC taxi trip

**Objective**: Build a machine learning productionized application to predict the ride duration of NYC taxis

**Goal**: To learn the end-to-end aspect of deploying machine learning models

**Learnings**:
  * Experiment Tracking with MLFlow
  * Model management with MLFlow
  * Containeraize the application for reporduciblity
  * Workflow orchestration
  * Deploying workflow orchestration on cloud
  * REST API model serving
  * Testing (Code, Data and Model)
  * Batch and Stream deployment methods
  * Monitor model and data drift after deployment
  * Estalibsh CI/CD pipeline
